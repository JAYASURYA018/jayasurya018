1.For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)



// for loop with keys
let key =Object.keys(obj);
for(let i=0;i<key.length;i++)
console.log(key[i])
// for loop with values
let value =Object.values(obj);
for(let j=0;j<value.length;j++)
console.log(value[j]);
//iterate with the help of for Each loop
key.forEach(keyval => {console.log(keyval,obj[keyval]);});
// iterate using for in 
for (let keyin in obj)
console.log(keyin)
 // iterate using for of
 for (let keyof in obj)
console.log(obj[keyof]);




2. create a resume on json format



 var Resume = [
              { name : "jayasurya",
                address : "nagari",
                hobbies : "playing pubg" ,

                  HSC:"himaja junior college",
                  qualification : "B.E"

                  project : "Behavioural feature analysis on Anomalys Based System",

3.Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript

Window -window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.

Screen- It is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

Document - It is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.
