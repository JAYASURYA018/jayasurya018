 1.Difference between http1.1 vs http2 ?
Ans -HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.
    -HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection,
    -while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
    -TTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay,
     then the page loads faster.
